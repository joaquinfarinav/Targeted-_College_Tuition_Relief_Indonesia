This study investigates the impact of targeted college tuition relief programs on students' outcomes, with a specific focus on Indonesia's Kartu Indonesia Pintar-Kuliah program. Aimed at supporting human capital development among low-income students, this nationwide program targets marginalized groups and areas, offering a smart card for college tuition and living expenses. Using the Indonesian National Socio-Economic Survey data (2016-2022), we examine the program's causal influence on high school retention, college enrollment, part-time employment, and socioeconomic inequality gaps. Our difference-in-difference approach leverages the policy's exposure heterogeneity among cohorts and regional diversity in college access. Preliminary results indicate that program participation significantly increases college enrolment, with a 0.021 point (p<0.01) increase relative to non-participants. The study contributes new insights into the effects of large-scale, supply-side performance-conditional tuition relief policy in a developing country.
